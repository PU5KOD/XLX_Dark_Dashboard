# XLX_Dark_Dashboard
Custom dashboard with improvements and dark theme for XLX reflectors

The dashboard here is a fork of the default one that is installed together with XLXD Reflector but with a series of changes that improve the user experience.
In addition to the standard information, the following improvements were made:

1. Dark theme, along with the change in the page layout, it now makes it easier to read the information on the screen;
2. Adds users names and city to the "Recent Activity" and "Connected Stations" tabs;
3. Changes the layout of information displayed, improving the readability of the information displayed through changing the order of the columns, and now displaying the users connected to each module below the main screen to optimize screen utilization;
4. The "Links" tab can now be hidden in the same way as the "Network" and "Traffic" items, the adjustment is made in config.inc.php file;
5. The "Network" tab has been completely redesigned and now displays more information in a readable format, including the date history of the last 30 days and others;
6. The "Traffic" tab now shows both networks, the legacy ircddb and main QuadNet, which is currently the most used and is registered as default in Pi-Star;
7. Several other minor customizations are available throughout the page, including data that is entered during installation and can be changed later in the settings file.

There are a few more changes I would still like to make, I will publish these as I develop them.
