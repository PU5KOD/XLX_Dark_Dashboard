# XLX_Dark_Dashboard
Custom dashboard with improvements and dark theme for XLX reflectors

The dashboard here is a fork of the default one that is installed together with XLXD Reflector but with a series of changes that improve the user experience.
In addition to the standard information, the following improvements were made:
1. Dark theme, along with the change in the page layout, it now makes it easier to read the information on the screen;
2. Adds users names and city to the "Recent Activity" list;
3. Changes the display of information on the same screen, changing the order of the columns and displaying the users connected to each module below the main screen to optimize screen usage;
4. The "Links" tab can now be hidden in the same way as the "Network" and "Traffic" items, the adjustment is made in config.inc.php;
5. The "Network" tab has been completely redesigned and now displays more information in a readable format;
6. The "Traffic" tab now shows the main QuadNet network, which is currently the most used and is registered as default in Pi-Star.

There are a few more changes I would still like to make, I will publish these as I develop them.
